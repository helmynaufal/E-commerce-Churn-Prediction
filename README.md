# E-commerce Churn Prediction

Retaining customers from churn is important for e-commerce. It can impact to revenue of the company and its business. In this project, we will use a machine learning supervised model to make a churn prediction and give some business recommendations to reduce the churn rate to lower the potential revenue loss.

## Goal
Reduce the churn rate to lower potential revenue loss

## Objectives
- Identify potential causes of churn customer
- Develop a machine learning model to predict potential customer churn
- Suggest business recommendations to decrease churn rate

## Dataset
The dataset obtained from an e-commerce company comprises historical transactions of the customer. It has 20 columns, 5630 rows with multiple data types, and several columns consisting of null values.

## The Steps Involved <br>
Here is the list of the steps involved in the notebook to achieve the goal.

**1. Problem Statement** <br>
First, we need to define the problem that needs to be solved, so we can understand how to analyze the data and give a suggestion that might suit the issue.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis** <br>
In this step, we will explore the data to understand the meaning of each column in the dataset, find any patterns and gain insight from the data.

**3. Preprocessing** <br>
We will do several steps to ensure the data is clean enough to be processed including, data cleaning, data split and feature engineering.

**4. Modeling** <br>
Here, we will create, compare, and evaluate our machine-learning models and choose a suitable model based on the data.

**5. Recommendation** <br>
Suggest some business action to solve the problem based on the data and insight we have got.
